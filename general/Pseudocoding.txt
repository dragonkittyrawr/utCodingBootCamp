/***    NOTES ON PSEUDOCODING    ***/
/* 
My preferred path to successful coding is as follows : 
1. Prepare.
2. Plan.
3. Perform.
4. Perfect.
(Let's call these the 4 P's of success)
STEP 1 : Prepare.
    You've prepared by having some (even minimal) exposure to JavaScript. You've also prepared in other ways. Your computer is charged, you've scheduled time aside specifically to learn and code, and you are here today wanting to learn more!
STEP 2 : Plan.
    This is your pseudocoding stage! This is where you plan out what you're going to build, how you're going to build it, what technologies you will need, how you plan in integrating them together, and (if on a team project) who is currently working on what aspect of your project.
    When pseudocoding, always dig deeper. Ask 'What?' for each statement you write. Eventually, your pseudocode will break down into a single line of actual code. See example below:
    $(document);
    Ok? Document what?
    $(document).ready();
    Ok? What do we do when document is ready?
    $(document).ready(function(){   });
    Ok. We have a function, what does this function do?
    $(document).ready(function(){
        console.log();
    });
    Ok. What are we logging?
    $(document).ready(function(){
        console.log('This document is linked and ready!');
    });
    Oh...
STEP 3 : Perform.
    This is where you get to write and test your code! Remember to test your code often.
STEP 4 : Perfect.
    Let's be honest. You're never done perfecting a project. But once you have a working project you can continuously tinker with it and add new features and/or optimize existing ones!
