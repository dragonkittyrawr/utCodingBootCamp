	<p>You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality. Dear Sir stroke Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of... Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality.</p>

Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then.</p>
